**Magic Lens** is a lightweight and efficient library for detecting **Magic: The Gathering** cards from images and webcam feeds, optimized for low computational cost. It can accurately identify multiple cards even in challenging conditions, such as overlapping layouts, partial visibility, tilted angles, poor lighting, or complex backgrounds. Designed for real-time recognition, it allows seamless integration into applications like deck builders, collection managers, and other MTG-related tools.
